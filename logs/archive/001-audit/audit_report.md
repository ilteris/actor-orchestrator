# Audit Report: 001-audit

## Context Established
- **Current Directory**: `/Users/ilteris/Code/swarm-test-bed`
- **Structure**:
    - `tasks/`: Contains JSON task definitions (001-audit, 002-feature, 003-docs).
    - `status_log.md`: Tracks high-level swarm progress.
    - `tmp/001-audit/`: Active working directory for this task.
- **Observations**:
    - The repository is currently empty of source code.
    - It appears to be a "clean slate" for testing the Actor-Orchestrator swarm logic.
    - No `.git` directory was found in the local `ls -la`, though the system prompt mentions the directory is managed by git.

## Task State
- Task `001-audit` is now complete.
- Task `002-feature` is unblocked.

## Next Steps
- Transition to `002-feature` (Implement Mock Feature).
