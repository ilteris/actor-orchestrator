# Explorer Report for bench-1769963707-9

## Objective
Execute a liveness check and analyze the progress of the current scaling benchmark run (`1769963707`).

## Observations
- **Concurrency Check**: Observed successful completion of tasks 0, 1, 2, and 3 within the first 60 seconds of the run.
- **Environment Hygiene**: The `tasks/` directory contains 10 active task definitions for this run.
- **Resource Usage**: No significant bottlenecks detected in the filesystem operations for log generation.
- **Protocol Adherence**: Workers are consistently generating both `_ls.txt` and `_report.md` artifacts.

## Analysis
The Actor-Orchestrator is demonstrating stable horizontal scaling. Task 9 (this task) confirms that the supervisor is successfully dispatching even the higher-indexed tasks in the batch.

## Key Artifacts Created
- `logs/bench-1769963707-9_ls.txt`
- `logs/bench-1769963707-9_report.md`
