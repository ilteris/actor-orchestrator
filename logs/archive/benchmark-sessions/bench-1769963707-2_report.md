# Explorer Report for bench-1769963707-2

## Objective
Analyze the codebase structure and identify key components for scalability benchmarking.

## Analysis
The directory listing was captured in `logs/bench-1769963707-2_ls.txt`. 
The system is currently undergoing intensive benchmarking with multiple concurrent task flows.
Key structural components identified:
- **Core Logic**: `scaling_bench.py`, `feature.py`.
- **Infrastructure**: `inboxes/`, `tasks/`, `logs/`.
- **State**: `TODO.md`, `README.md`.

## Findings
- High volume of evaluation artifacts (`evaluation_report_*.md`) suggests the need for periodic garbage collection or structured archiving to `logs/archive/`.
- Active benchmarking session (1769963707 series) shows consistent output generation.

## Conclusion
Codebase structure is stable and follows agentic patterns (inbox/task/log).
