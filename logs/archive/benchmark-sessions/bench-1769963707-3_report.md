# Task Report: bench-1769963707-3 (Explorer Audit)

## Objective
Scaling benchmark sub-task audit for node 3.

## System Audit
- **Task ID**: bench-1769963707-3
- **Contract**: Explorer
- **Directory State**: Captured in `logs/bench-1769963707-3_ls.txt`

## Observations
- The codebase structure remains consistent with the Swarm Test Bed architecture.
- Task status was incorrectly marked as completed without proper artifact generation in the previous turn.
- The evaluation noted a missing `ls.txt` artifact, which has now been remediated.

## Files Checked
- `tasks/bench-1769963707-3.json`: Verified metadata and priority.
- `README.md`: Verified project context.
- `TODO.md`: Verified task tracking.

## Status
Artifacts regenerated and audit complete.
