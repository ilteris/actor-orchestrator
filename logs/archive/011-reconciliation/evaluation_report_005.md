# Evaluation Report: 005-refactor

## Status: PASS

### Audit Details
- **Technical Correctness**: The implementation of `get_greeting` and its corresponding tests in `test_feature.py` are correct and functioning as expected.
- **Architectural Alignment**: The code follows basic Python conventions and incorporates clean docstrings.
- **Stoic Precision**: The refactor is minimal and effective. The test coverage is appropriate for the complexity of the feature.

### Recommendations for Future Improvements
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling if the inputs to `get_greeting` were to become more complex.
- Integrate these tests into a CI pipeline if one exists for the project.
