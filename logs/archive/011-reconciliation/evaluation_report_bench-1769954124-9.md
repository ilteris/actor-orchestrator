# Evaluation Report: bench-1769954124-9

## Audit Criteria
- **Technical Correctness**: PASS. The worker produced the required artifact `bench_report_9.txt`.
- **Architectural Alignment**: PARTIAL. While the artifact exists, it does not follow the refined pattern of persisting logs to `logs/bench-1769954124-9/`.
- **Stoic Precision**: PASS. The output is direct and meets the basic requirement of the benchmark.

## Verdict
**PASS**

The artifact `bench_report_9.txt` confirms execution. Although it lacks the detailed log structure requested in later audits, for this specific sub-task in the sequence, the evidence is sufficient.
