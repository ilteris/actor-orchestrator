# High-Fidelity Exploration Report: bench-1769956087-9

## Overview
This report synthesizes the exploration of the swarm-test-bed codebase as part of scaling benchmark sub-task 9.

## Findings
1. Orchestration Core: The project utilizes a tasks/ directory for state management.
2. Log Infrastructure: Artifacts are decentralized across logs/ and archive folders.
3. Telemetry: supervisor.jsonl in inboxes/ is the primary channel.
