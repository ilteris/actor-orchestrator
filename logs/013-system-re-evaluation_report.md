# Post-Dormancy System Evaluation Report
**Task ID**: 013-system-re-evaluation
**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: Completed

## 1. System State Analysis
The `swarm-test-bed` is currently in a "Dormant" state following the successful completion of the 011 reconciliation. All primary architectural goals, specifically those related to state reliability and scalability, have been met.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Archived Tasks**: 63
- **Total Log Directories**: 31
- **Feature Status**: `feature.py` is fully operational and verified by `test_feature.py`.
- **Infrastructure Health**: All robustness patches are in place.

## 2. Architectural Audit
The following critical infrastructure components were audited:
- **State Management**: The "Worker-Owned State" protocol (Claim/Finish) is active. Tasks are successfully claimed via `claim_task.py` and finalized via `finish_task.py`.
- **Persistence**: `update_task_patch.py` (and the corresponding skill script) correctly implements `fsync()` and artifact verification.
- **Scalability**: The system successfully handled 10 concurrent explorer tasks without artifact loss or state corruption, as documented in `final_benchmark_summary.md`.

## 3. Findings & Recommendations

### A. Optimization: Script Consolidation
- **Finding**: There is some redundancy between the project's root scripts (`update_task_patch.py`) and the skill's internal scripts.
- **Recommendation**: Transition all workers to use the standardized skill-based scripts exclusively to ensure consistency across different swarm environments.

### B. Scalability: Supervisor Parallelism
- **Finding**: While horizontal scaling of workers is achieved, the Supervisor's evaluation phase remains largely sequential.
- **Recommendation**: Future iterations of `SwarmOS` should explore an asynchronous evaluation model to reduce "burst" latency.

### C. Cleanliness: Task Archive Management
- **Finding**: The `tasks/archive/` directory is growing rapidly (63+ files).
- **Recommendation**: Implement a tiered archival strategy (e.g., monthly sub-folders) to maintain high performance of `ls` and `grep` operations on the blackboard.

## 4. Conclusion
The system is stable, robust, and performs as expected post-dormancy. No immediate remediation is required. The `swarm-test-bed` serves as a high-fidelity reference for "Unix-for-AI" architectures.
