# Evaluation Report: bench-1769963707-5

### [ Interleaved Reflection ]
The task `bench-1769963707-5` is a sub-component of the scaling benchmark. Governance indicates `evaluated: true` in the JSON, and a previous evaluation report exists. However, I am performing a high-fidelity audit as the `evaluator` skill to ensure architectural alignment. The worker report (`bench-1769963707-5_report.md`) confirms successful processing.
