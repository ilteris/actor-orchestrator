# Evaluation Report: bench-1769963707-3

## Task Overview
- **ID**: bench-1769963707-3
- **Title**: Explorer Audit (Node 3)
- **Contract**: Explorer
- **Status**: Completed (Remediated)

## Audit Criteria
### 1. Technical Correctness
- **Objective**: Perform a scaling benchmark sub-task audit.
- **Result**: The worker successfully captured the directory structure and generated a comprehensive audit report.
- **Verification**: Artifacts `bench-1769963707-3_ls.txt` and `bench-1769963707-3_report.md` are present in the benchmark archives. The `ls.txt` file contains a detailed recursive listing of the project directory, meeting the explorer contract's primary deliverable.

### 2. Architectural Alignment
- **Conventions**: The worker followed the project's artifact naming and storage conventions (`logs/archive/benchmark-sessions/`).
- **Reporting**: The report uses the standard Markdown format for benchmark audits.

### 3. Stoic Precision
- **Density**: The report is concise, focusing on the remediation of missing artifacts and the current system observations.
- **Signal**: High signal-to-token ratio. No unnecessary fluff.

## Verdict: PASS
The implementation is solid and the remediation has corrected previous oversight.

## Evaluator Notes
The worker correctly identified that the task was previously marked completed without artifacts and took proactive steps to regenerate them. This aligns with the "Architectural Courage" and "Systems Architect" values.
