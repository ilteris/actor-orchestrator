# Swarm Session Chronicle: 2026-02-01
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Context**: Soul OS / Actor-Orchestrator Lifecycle Audit  

## 1. Executive Summary
The session of 2026-02-01 marked a critical transition from steady-state dormancy to a high-throughput orchestration phase. The "Unix-for-AI" ecosystem was formalized through the synthesis of Strategy 2026, followed by the deployment of real-time telemetry, automated health reporting, and semantic memory graphing. The system demonstrated robust failure recovery during the Task 031 reconciliation loop.

## 2. Architectural Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Task ID | Actor | Event | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **16:16 - 20:40** | N/A | Supervisor | Steady-State Dormancy | 100+ Pulse cycles recorded; system healthy. |
| **20:45:35** | 024 | worker-024 | Strategy Synthesis | Synthesized `STRATEGY_2026.md`; defined 4-System Protocol. |
| **20:45:35** | 026 | worker-026 | Heartbeat Verification | Created `HEARTBEAT.md`; established baseline presence. |
| **21:04:09** | 027 | worker-027 | SHAR Engine Deployment | Implemented `shar_engine.py`; automated daily briefings. |
| **21:05:06** | 028 | worker-028 | Telemetry Bridge | WebSocket bridge active (`ws://localhost:8765`). |
| **21:10:06** | 029 | worker-029 | Memory Graph Synthesis | Generated `graph_029.md`; visualized dependency arcs. |
| **21:10:06** | 030 | worker-030 | Swarm Health-Check | Implemented `swarm-health.py` diagnostic primitive. |
| **21:17:59** | 031 | worker-031 | Lifecycle Stress Test | **FAULT DETECTED**: Worker died; reconciliation initiated. |
| **21:25:44** | 031 | worker-031 | Stress Test (RETRY) | **RECOVERY SUCCESS**: Loop verified; state restored. |
| **21:43:30** | 034 | worker-034 | Session Chronicler | Aggregating session logs into cohesive timeline. |

## 3. Milestone Synthesis

### 1. The Strategy Pivot (Task 024)
Formalized the transition from ad-hoc task execution to a structured "Infrastructure & Systems Architect" role. Defined the **Unix-for-AI** execution layer.

### 2. Observable Intelligence (Tasks 027, 028, 030)
Transformed internal logs into queryable assets. The SHAR Engine and Telemetry Bridge provide real-time visibility into agent reasoning, while the Health-Check ensures process isolation.

### 3. Resilience & Reconciliation (Task 031)
Validated the "Reaper" protocol and the Supervisor's ability to identify and restart orphaned worker processes. The system self-corrected from a "FAILED" state to "COMPLETED" within 8 minutes.

## 4. System Metrics
- **Success Rate**: 90% (Initial) -> 100% (Post-Reconciliation).
- **Reflection Count**: 157 (Cumulative).
- **Protocol Adherence**: 100% (System 3 Audit).
- **Infrastructural Delta**: +4 Scripts, +1 WebSocket Service, +3 Architectural Artifacts.
