# Final Performance Benchmark Summary

The final scaling benchmark (1769956063) has been completed. All 10 sub-tasks were injected and executed by the swarm.

## Statistics
- **Total Tasks**: 10
- **Completed**: 10
- **Failed**: 0
- **Average Execution Time**: ~2 minutes (observed during monitoring)

## Artifacts
Artifacts for each sub-task are located in the `logs/` directory:
- `logs/bench-1769956063-X_report.md`: Summary report.
- `logs/bench-1769956063-X_ls.txt`: Recursive directory listing captured during execution.

## Conclusion
The system successfully handled 10 concurrent explorer contracts without significant degradation or blocked states. The "Unix-for-AI" architecture demonstrates stable orchestration for high-throughput agent workloads.
